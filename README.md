#Simon pour META

The META is a french console that you can program (https://gamebuino.com) to make your own games and share with others. 
(If you don't like program, i don't know why you ae reading this readme but you can only have fun with the games  ;) )

Simon pour META is a game to play with the clasic Game Simon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))
"Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope. 
The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. 
Once the user fails, the game is over."
With multi players, it's same: the game add a note and the players ae playing all the sequence alternatively. 
The first making an error in the sequence is eliminated. 
I have fix the limit of players at 4 because i think it's enough and because i think that for more players it's will be less fun.

Note: To have text into english in the game, you have to set your console into english first
      The original interface was using very fine the buttons to say to each player that it was his turn, to select number of players, asw...
      I think that this choice has been made because they had to do with the hardware they had (and they have done it vey fine) but me, i can use menus and messages, so have i have change the original interface, even that now i have to translate all the menus and messages.
      (If i had kept the original version, i would not have to translate the message given by the lights on the buttons !!)
      I have set 4 langages atm English, French, Deutsch, Spanish if you want add your hown language, just send me the modified language.cpp
      If i make errors when i have translated a message please send it to me.
      
Have fun with this game
